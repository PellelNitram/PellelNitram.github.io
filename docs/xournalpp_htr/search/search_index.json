Each concept explores a different approach to HTR and possibly improves over previous concepts, but not necessarily to allow for freedom in risky experiments. Concept 1 is already implemented and uses a computer vision approach that is explained below.</p> <p>Future concepts might explore:</p> <ul> <li>Retrain computer vision models from concept 1 using native online data representation of Xournal++</li> <li>Use sequence-to-sequence models to take advantage of native online data representation of Xournal++; e.g. use OnlineHTR</li> <li>Use data augmentation to increase effective size of training data</li> <li>Use of language models to correct for spelling mistakes</li> </ul>"},{"location":"developer_guide/#concept-1","title":"Concept 1","text":"<p>This concept uses computer vision based algorithms to first detect words on a page and then to read those words.</p> <p>The following shows a video demo on YouTube using real-life handwriting data from a Xournal file:</p> <p></p> <p>Despite not being perfect, the main take away is that the performance is surprisingly good given that the underlying algorithm has not been optimised for Xournal++ data at all.</p> <p>The performance is sufficiently good to be useful for the Xournal++ user base.</p> <p>Feel free to play around with the demo yourself using this code after installing this project.

While we are eager to implement advanced machine learning algorithms, we must first focus on usability improvements.</p> <p>Our main mid-term objective is to simplify the installation process, as users have reported it is too complex.</p> <p>Explanation of the steps:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Reimplement htr_pipeline:   We currently use the excellent htr_pipeline by Harald Scheidl for machine learning, but it being an external dependency complicates installation and them hosting model weights on Dropbox is not suitable for our needs. To address this, we plan to integrate these models directly into our project. Since the original repository lacks a license, we'll implement our own version, drawing inspiration from the existing work. This approach will deliver an easy-to-install product quickly, as we already know the requirements &amp; model details. Additionally, it enhances our understanding of training models for both online and offline handwriting data. With our own models, we'll automate model retrieval and establish a model registry, likely using Hugging Face, as part of adhering to MLOps best practices. Experimentation with new algorithms will benefit from the model registry and will occur subsequently, as it is more time-consuming.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make installation easier:   We aim to make the installation process seamless across platforms, including Linux and Windows, with future support for Mac if access becomes available to us. Implementing a model registry will streamline model management and deployment, aiding future model development and enhancing ease of use while aligning with best practices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Introduce quality measures:   To identify the best model, we need to quantify performance. Ideally, one metric will suffice, but two may be necessary if recognition and transcription remain separate tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Classic algos w OnlineHTR:   The plan is to use OnlineHTR for transcription alongside classical (non-data-driven) algorithms for recognition.</p> </li> <li> <p>Graph NN w OnlineHTR:   We aim to use OnlineHTR for transcription and a graph neural network for recognition. This approach seeks to develop a high-performing model that operates on the native online representation of handwriting.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"user_guide/","title":"Usage","text":"<p>The usage of the project is fairly simple.
