</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did 120 push ups, 6 times 20 repetitions spread arbitrarily over the day, for 30 days
starting the 04/24/2017. The last of these workouts has been done the 23rd of May 2017 without
skipping any repetition during the 30 days. After all, I performed 3600 push&amp;nbsp;ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the 29th of May 2017, I measured my maximal number of push ups anew. Initially, I performed
42 with 20 warming up&amp;nbsp;repetitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time without warming up repetitions, I performed 70 push ups. This is a performance I am
happy&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="experiences"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After approximately 15 days into the challenge, I felt that my handstand and overall
shoulder strength increased. Exercices such as holding a frog position without leaning on my knees
became more accessible and the initial phase of a straddle press felt like I could make future progress
with. In comparison to my pull up challenge of 50 pull ups a day for 30 days in the winter 2015/2016,
this challenge has not had an as big impact on my daily life in terms of soreness and time consumption.
However, also the performance increase hasn&amp;#8217;t been as dramatic. Generally, one should make sure that the
excercise performed in such a challenge is not too difficult as the body will struggle even with the
simplest excercises when repeated that often. While I underestimated that for the past
pull up challenge, I did take this into account for the just finished push up challenge. Getting the 6
sets done over a day was relatively easy so that one could think of performing more than 6 sets. I
did the repetitions exclusively on parallets which (a) protected my wrists and (b) increased the range of
motion. My wrists never made any problems and, amazingly, I got used to the increased range of motion
so that regular flat-hand push ups feel easy now. While the wrists were fine throughout the challenge,
my shoulder felt irritated sometimes. However, never to the degree of pain but mostly only&amp;nbsp;cracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="outlook"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various future challanges came to my&amp;nbsp;mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3x 50 push up repetitions a day: For increasing the maximal number. 20 repetitions were too easy
after some&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L sit to tucked press (explained in terms of the frog position above). I might train these excercises
separately at first to build up enough strength for the&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frog stand on&amp;nbsp;parallets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stretching routine each&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stretching routine seems the most appealing for me now as it is more passive after such an active&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I apply the training method &amp;#8220;Greasing the groove&amp;#8221; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#gtg" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; to my push up performance.
My interpretation of this method&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not train the excercise to&amp;nbsp;fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train the excercise very&amp;nbsp;frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application to push ups means in this case for&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the maximal performance. Performance is measured as number of
proper-form push ups. To relax my wrists and increase the range of motion, I use my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt;
parallets or knuckles if no parallets are available. &lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;:
42 push ups after a warm up set of 20&amp;nbsp;repetitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform half of the maximal performance - 20 in my case at the time being -
six times each day for 30 days. I determined the set number of six by available
time each day, integration in my other physical training and exhaustion. The number of
sets should be distributed equally over the day and are possibly integrated in other training
occasions. The equal distribution includes working times and time at&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purposes of this study&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase push up performance. While push ups are an essential excercise, I found
them surprisingly exhausting. I had very good experience with 50 (ring) pull ups
each day for 30 days for my pull up performance in winter&amp;nbsp;2015/2016.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase overall push performance. This will help for more complex composite movements
that I am weak&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a better push up&amp;nbsp;form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start date is tomorrow, &lt;strong&gt;04/24/2017&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
