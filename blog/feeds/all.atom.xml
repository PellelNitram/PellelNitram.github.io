</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In around August 2018, I switched my phone&amp;#8217;s language from English to Russian. I switched it back to English mid-September of this year&amp;nbsp;(2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of switching my phone to Russian arose from the desire to expose myself to the Russian language more authentically in daily life. As my phone is my daily fellow, using it in Russian suggested&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a vacation in an Eastern Russians-speaking country in September 2019, I came to the conclusion that this strategy is suboptimal at this point in time. These are the major three reasons why I decided to switch it back, sorted according to their&amp;nbsp;importance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My level of Russian is admittedly not high enough to make practical use of this daily authentic&amp;nbsp;exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studying Russian at an beginner-ish level, adhering to text books seems to be a more efficient solution. The latter approach appears to be a denser and more explicit learning experience. Despite its lack of authenticity, it is probably more efficient at the beginning of learning a&amp;nbsp;language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phone&amp;#8217;s usability is severely crippled if one does not honestly attempt to learn all the new words one is exposed&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to conclude by encouraging you, fellow language learners, to try it out in your target language! It is indeed very authentic and learning through this approach by the mechanism of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosis"&gt;osmosis&lt;/a&gt; did work for me. I haven&amp;#8217;t learned as many new words as I wanted to but this is solely due to me being not consistent enough and now having a high enough skill level in Russian, yet. In the future, I will certainly set my phone back to Russian&amp;nbsp;again!&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I like my bike and want to protect it from evil thieves. For that, I use an old solid
lock that comes with the downside of being quite bulky to carry while riding my&amp;nbsp;bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are solutions to this such as putting it in a backpack or holding it in
my hand while riding. But &amp;#8230; where is the fun with these? In particular, when there is
my 3D printer waiting eagerly for jobs. The following figure shows the frame of my bike
from the side. Clearly, there is space for some 3D printed mounting solution&amp;nbsp;:-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/hr/0_picture_of_frame.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/lr/0_picture_of_frame.jpg" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Side view of my bike&amp;#8217;s frame. The red arrow indicates available space for
a 3D printed mounting solution for my bike&amp;nbsp;lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the idea in mind to 3D print my prospective bike lock mount, this task becomes
a well-defined engineering question. Hence, I model it digitally as a first&amp;nbsp;step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="modeling-the-problem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Modeling the&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bike&amp;#8217;s frame is modeled in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Autodesk Fusion 360&lt;/em&gt;. Subsequently, the
same is performed for my old&amp;nbsp;lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I import the above figure into &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageJ"&gt;ImageJ&lt;/a&gt;
to determine the angle between the two major rods accurately. This is shown in the following
figure. Second, the bike lock is measured and drawn in 3D as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/hr/1_measuring_angles.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/lr/1_measuring_angles.png" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Measuring the geometry of my bike&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After modeling the physical system, the fun of designing the bike lock mount itself
begins. Keeping in mind that this design will be 3D printed, I chose a three-part
approach: two identical parts are used as attachments to the frame and the third part
mounts the lock. Without further explaining the design with bare words, please check out
the video below to see how it works in an animation. The white pieces are 3D printed
and metal screws (not shown) are used to hold all pieces&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin: 0px auto; text-align: center;"&gt;
    &lt;iframe width="650" height="365" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYmiPLFMNRY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the following figure shows a rendering of the whole setup while being
mounted to the bike&amp;nbsp;frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/hr/2_rendering.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/lr/2_rendering.png" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Rendering of the designed 3D&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design is printed on my 3D printer in white &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLA&lt;/span&gt;. It took around 2x 7h plus 1x 9h, accumulating
to 23h of print time. This long print time arises from the somewhat rigid design and
the very slow print speed that I used. Prior to the design shown in the video above, there existed a
previous design that I did not use due to a failed test print which revealed that it was too bulky.
After the 3D printer finished
with my final design, it was carefully sanded and tested for proper fitting. The following shows
the parts layed out on a&amp;nbsp;table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/hr/3_parts.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/lr/3_parts.jpg" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;All parts that are necessary for the assembly. The white parts were 3D printed and the remaining
items are the metal screws and&amp;nbsp;washers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the following two images present a test assembly of the design and verify that not only the
designed parts fit together but also that the lock fits inside. With this, the assembly is ready to be mounted
to the&amp;nbsp;bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/hr/4_half_assembly.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/lr/4_half_assembly.jpg" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Half assembled bike lock mount with inserted metal&amp;nbsp;screws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/hr/5_test_assembly.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/lr/5_test_assembly.jpg" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Finished test assembly. The lock does fit inside the&amp;nbsp;design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mounting-the-3d-print"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mounting the 3D&amp;nbsp;print&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After cleaning the relevant parts of the bike, the bike lock mount is installed.
First, a rubber band is wrapped around the bike shaft to improve adhesion of
the mount to the bike in azimuthal direction. This can be seen in the following&amp;nbsp;figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/hr/6_rubber.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/lr/6_rubber.jpg" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Rubber band wrapped around the bike shaft to increase adhesion of the 3D&amp;nbsp;print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the two identical parts are screwed around the shaft in order to, finally, screw the last 3D
printed piece to the two identical parts. The following two figures show these steps in&amp;nbsp;detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/hr/7_bike_assembly_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/lr/7_bike_assembly_1.jpg" style="height: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The two identical 3D printed pieces are mounted to the&amp;nbsp;frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/hr/8_bike_assembly_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/bike_lock_mount_3d_print/lr/8_bike_assembly_2.jpg" style="width: 500px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Subsequently, the last piece is mounted to the pieces installed beforehand and the bike lock
is&amp;nbsp;inserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, the build is finished and my bike lock mount is safetly mounted to the bike.
Finally, no more dangling around of the&amp;nbsp;lock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I model a part of my bike in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt; and 3D print a plastics mounting assembly for my bike lock.
The assembly has been in use for one week now and everything continues to work&amp;nbsp;great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few lessons have been learned along the&amp;nbsp;way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt; modeling for such pieces is incredibly useful. One can avoid improper prototypes
by creating good models, e.g. ensuring that all moving parts will behave as&amp;nbsp;desired.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Model as much as possible. I forgot to model a minute section of the bike lock which
later required heavy manual post&amp;nbsp;processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no engineering without ideas on how to improve the part. I do not plan to
3D print another version of this design but in case I had to, the following two
improvements would be integrated: (1) A hole inside the housing of the bike lock mount
body in order to drain water and (2) a design that is a little bit less massive. The
latter comes from the fact that I tend to design my functional 3D prints too massive
in their first iteration because I underestimate the strength of 3D printed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to contact me via email if you have any questions that remain, I would be very happy
to assist you in a similar process or give extra information about my own experiences. I don&amp;#8217;t provide the model
files of the 3D print here because they are very specific to my particular bike and therefore probably
useless for anybody else. Nevertheless, drop me an email if you would like to get the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STL&lt;/span&gt; files of
my&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the obligatory evidence of the bike lock mount in wildlife - as found
at places that might be familiar to people from&amp;nbsp;Marburg.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In order to document what I was able to achieve while &lt;a class="reference external" href="{filename}/ignored/Qualitative/learning_Italian_for_30_days.rst"&gt;learning Italian for one month&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to be able to export my Anki statistics to a data format that could be processed and plotted manually. It turns out that there is no feature in the Anki desktop client that enables the easy export of the computed statistics data that is shown on the statistics&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I found a hack-ish workaround by tweaking the original Anki code that computes the statistics in order to export the data myself. This article is a quick explanation of how to export the statistics that is generated by&amp;nbsp;Anki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we&amp;nbsp;go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Find the Anki installation by typing &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;whereis anki&lt;/tt&gt; in your Linux terminal. My output&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ whereis anki
anki: /usr/bin/anki /usr/share/anki /usr/share/man/man1/anki.1.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking these paths reveals that &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/usr/share/anki&lt;/tt&gt; is the path that contains the source files of the Anki desktop client. These files are written in Python. Therefore, it is easy to modify&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Within &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/usr/share/anki&lt;/tt&gt;, the file &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/usr/share/anki/anki/stats.py&lt;/tt&gt; contains all the code that computes the statistics and outputs the data to the corresponding window of the Anki desktop&amp;nbsp;client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The code in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;stats.py&lt;/tt&gt; is self-explanatory and can be modified to one&amp;#8217;s liking. Let me state one example here: The method &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;dueGraph()&lt;/tt&gt; is modified to export the statistics data that it computes anyway. It should be denoted at that point that Anki informs you about errors if erroneous code has been added to any function - that makes debugging your added code quite comfortable. The code is changed as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
# Original version
def dueGraph(self):
    ...
    txt += self._dueInfo(tot, len(totd)*chunk)
    return txt

# Hacked version
def dueGraph(self):
    ...
    txt += self._dueInfo(tot, len(totd)*chunk)
    # &amp;lt;&amp;lt; Start of new code
    import os
    with open(os.path.join('/home/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;', 'dueGraph.dat'), 'a') as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
    # End of new code &amp;gt;&amp;gt;
    return txt
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The additional code block creates a file &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;/home/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;/dueGraph.dat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; where &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; must be replaced by your username. This file contains the data that is used to generate the plot called &amp;#8220;Forecast&amp;#8221; in the statistics&amp;nbsp;window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The original plot called &amp;#8220;Forecast&amp;#8221; is shown&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/export_Anki_statistics_manually/forecast_default_plot.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/export_Anki_statistics_manually/forecast_default_plot.png" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The original figure &amp;#8220;Forecast&amp;#8221; from the stats report generated by the Anki desktop&amp;nbsp;client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;The data that is written to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;/home/&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;/dueGraph.dat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; can be used easily to generate a plot that is to your liking based on the underlying data. That is shown in the following figure. This figure has been generated with a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/plot_dueGraph.py"&gt;simple Python&lt;/a&gt; script using matplotlib and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/dueGraph.dat"&gt;the exported data of my Anki deck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/export_Anki_statistics_manually/forecast_custom_plot.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/export_Anki_statistics_manually/forecast_custom_plot.png" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The underlying data is used to generate a custom&amp;nbsp;figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;We are&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding, it is possible to adapt the original Anki source code to export the statistics data manually, which, ultimately, enables one to create custom plots around that data. While the above procedure shows how already computed data is exported, own statistics based on the raw data in the Anki database could be computed and exported as well. However, attention must be brought to the fact that the plotted data of the above two figures appears &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to be the same. I was not able to spot any mistakes from my side or apparent code passages that modify the data after I save it manually in the Anki source&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this article shows that exporting the data is a straightforward process but caution is advised when using the data without any prior&amp;nbsp;inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos go to Leonard Salewski for his valuable tip to study Anki plugins in order to understand the inner workings of Anki, which led to this hack of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;stats.py&lt;/tt&gt; file, and also for general discussions about Anki to enhance the personal learning&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="section" id="the-settings"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of the year, I have decided to meet a few good friends in Italy this September. Having had no prior experience with the Italian language except for hearing conversations of others, I decided to start to learn Italian autodidactically from scratch approximately one month prior to my trip to Italy. Simply as an experiment about what is feasible in such a short amount of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-stategy"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My&amp;nbsp;stategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I have had good experiences with Duolingo for freshing up some rusty language skills as well as starting a completely new language, I decided to use the Duolingo app on my phone during the time of the experiment. Since I was working full time professionally, I limited the time spent on Duolingo to 5 minutes per&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different from how I used Duolingo earlier, I decided to accompany the Duolingo activity with daily review activities on Anki. I constrained myself to 5 minutes of Duolingo time because I wanted to put extra emphasis on Anki: Whatever I learned through Duolingo, I planned to type in Anki to repeat the Duolingo content even further. I knew that the time spent on Anki grows roughly linearly with time in the beginning of using Anki for a new subject so that utilising only 5 minutes per day for Duolingo plus the time spent on Anki to repeat the Duolingo content seemed realistic to me. I configured Anki to introduce 3 new cards to me per&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to focus on Anki because I&amp;#8217;ve had phenomenal experiences with Anki regarding other subjects. I use it daily for reviewing flash cards that deal with Physics, computer science and language knowledge. My experiences show that whatever I type into Anki burns into my mind, justifying spending more time on Anki than on Duolingo for this&amp;nbsp;experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-leading-questions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The leading&amp;nbsp;questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose for conducting this experiment is manyfold. The following questions were of interest to me, in increasing generalising&amp;nbsp;order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much of Italian is it possible to learn in one&amp;nbsp;month?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How well do Duolingo and Anki play together? What are the timescales one is making progress for each of&amp;nbsp;them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How well does the strategy work out for a language? I conjecture that the answer to that question generalises to other languages as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How realistic is such a strategy during working full&amp;nbsp;time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-results"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I conducted the experiment successfully without any days left out. Below, the Duolingo activity overview after half of the experiment can be&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/learning_Italian_for_30_days/duolingo_scores.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/learning_Italian_for_30_days/duolingo_scores.png" style="width: 400px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The Duolingo activity overview taken from the weekly emails one gets when using&amp;nbsp;Duolingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following figure - taken from the Anki statistics feature - shows my Anki statistics after the whole experiment and reveals how many new words I learned, how much time I spent and how many flash cards I have reviewed, amongst&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/learning_Italian_for_30_days/statistics_composite.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/learning_Italian_for_30_days/statistics_composite.png" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;My Anki statistics of learning Italian for one month. Each letter corresponds to one evaluation and the letters (i) and (ii)
correspond to the monthly and yearly statistics, respectively. The latter is shown since I learned Italian for a few days more than one&amp;nbsp;month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most apparent results are the following ones. I&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; spent &lt;strong&gt;1 hour&lt;/strong&gt; of reviewing Anki flashcards with an average of &lt;strong&gt;1.4 minutes per day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; reviewed &lt;strong&gt;708 flashcards&lt;/strong&gt; with an average of &lt;strong&gt;14.4 flashcards per day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; spent an average of &lt;strong&gt;5.9s per cards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; added &lt;strong&gt;162 flashcards&lt;/strong&gt; altogether. After the whole month, &lt;strong&gt;26 flashcards remained unseen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter aspect reveals that Anki operates on a slower timescale than Duolingo does since I used solely Duolingo content for my Anki studies. Thus, when using Duolingo as an input for new content, the additional learning process with Anki is delayed. However, whatever is entered into Anki really burns into my mind. For me, it felt that if I progressed with Duolingo as fast as possible, the progress speed with the content from Duolingo would be slightly too fast for me. With that knowledge, I can adjust any future experiments with that fact in&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting fact was that my very small experience of hearing Italian conversations really helped in studying Italian. It seemed to me like I knew the basic phonetics and potential ways to pronouce the words that I learned. This finding emphasises the advice that many experienced language learners give: Expose yourself to the spoken language as much as possible while learning the respective&amp;nbsp;language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the same lines, learning a language in conjuntion with visiting the corresponding country once in a while makes sense. Not only does it boost one&amp;#8217;s motivation but it also familarises with the sound of the language. Last but not least, the native speakers you meet make up a large portion of the fun of learning a new&amp;nbsp;language!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="future-directions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future&amp;nbsp;directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most apparent extension to this experiment is to do it for a longer time, e.g. for one summer or one year. Since I would like to refresh another language first and want to try to use Anki for other types of knowledge at this point in time, I am not able to continue this experiment with Italian for now. However, I will use it with the afore mentioned other&amp;nbsp;language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me present to you what my conclusions&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One does learn quite a bit in such a short amount of time, even with limited time spent. However, since I was able to check my progress right in Italy, I have to admit that there is a lot more to be learned before a language is usable after an experiment like this. Anyway, it gave some good intro to that language and I&amp;#8217;d do it again for either the same or other&amp;nbsp;languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The experiment showed to me that Anki alone is not the best. By that, my experiment confirmed &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#downloading-shared-decks"&gt;Anki&amp;#8217;s recommendation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to use Anki for stand-alone knowledge but to use it in conjuntion with other types of classes or&amp;nbsp;tutorials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the former, it is clear that also applying the gained knowledge is advisable. For instance with an additional language course, a tandem buddy, by writing texts or&amp;nbsp;traveling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No writing about Italy without a pretty&amp;nbsp;picture!&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Amongst others, I developed a code for simulating Newtonian fluids such as water
during my Master studies. Choosing proper settings, one can easily generate large
amounts of 3D data that resembles a turbulent flow in a&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A snapshot of this data was captured and 3D printed. From that, a silicone mould was
made and used to cast a resin version of the simulation&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, I am able to hold my abstract experiments from my studies in Theoretical
Physics in my own hands. It took a long way from performing the simulation on a
powerful super computer to creating a real-life silicone mould with which the data
can be&amp;nbsp;casted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps that I performed are the following&amp;nbsp;ones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate the turbulent data in a channel flow geometry. The boundary conditions
are periodic in spanwise and streamwise directions. The wall-normal direction
uses free-slip boundary&amp;nbsp;conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data is exported to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VTR&lt;/span&gt; format which is read by ParaView. From there,
it is exported as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STL&lt;/span&gt;. ParaView is used to find a nice iso surface in the
time&amp;nbsp;series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The raw simulation data is post-processed in Blender to generate a file
that can be 3D&amp;nbsp;printed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The post-processed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STL&lt;/span&gt; is 3D&amp;nbsp;printed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 3D print is sanded and subsequently coated with a fill primer to hide the
3D print specific layer&amp;nbsp;structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A silicone mould is made from the 3D print which is finally used for the resin&amp;nbsp;cast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following video visualizes the simulation from which the 3D printed data is taken.
The flow in the simulation box is color
coded where red values are large positive values in the flow  direction and blue values are large negative
values in the flow direction. The flow direction is the x coordinate. The gray surface at t=0 is the one
that is 3D printed and resin casted here. The video shows the turbulent evolution of that surface in&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://lellep.xyz/blog/videos/turbulentDataCast/turbulence_isosurfaces.mp4"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://lellep.xyz/blog/images/turbulentDataCast/turbulence_isosurfaces_frontPic.png" style="width: 600px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The simulation data that has been used for the&amp;nbsp;cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is a mp4 file and can either be downloaded or viewed directly in the&amp;nbsp;browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-outcome"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;outcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, the result of the cast is shown: It is the transparent piece which took
two days to cure inside the silicone&amp;nbsp;mould.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Resin cast and its&amp;nbsp;template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-details"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data is acquired by running the simulation that I wrote for a sufficiently
long time in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations&amp;#8217; turbulent regime at
Re=400. My simulation is based on a pseudo-spectral algorithm so that one
can reconstruct the full velocity fields from the spectral expansion coefficients
at arbitrary spatial resolutions. The fields are reconstructed and
saved as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VTR&lt;/span&gt; files (using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/pauloh/pyevtk"&gt;PyEVTK&lt;/a&gt;).
These can be opened in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.paraview.org/"&gt;ParaView&lt;/a&gt; to study how
the fields evolve over time. After deciding upon one flow field and
one of its iso surfaces, the spectral coefficients are used to generate a very
high-resolution spatial field. This data is saved as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STL&lt;/span&gt; file is post-processed in Blender: The 2D iso surface is extruded
downwards to obtain a true 3D structure that can be 3D printed. Furthermore,
small artifacts or structures that are hard to 3D print are&amp;nbsp;removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model is 3D printed in black &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLA&lt;/span&gt;. I tested multiple sizes and multiple vertical resolutions
on an UltiMaker 3. After holding all the 3D prints in my hand I decided to pick
the highest vertical resolution of 0.1mm and a size of 9mm x 6mm x 3mm. This
model is sanded down and white fill primer is applied to hide the vertical layers. It turns out
that this last step reduces the visible vertical layers very well.
That procedure might be an alternative to using an acetone bath for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABS&lt;/span&gt; in
case &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABS&lt;/span&gt; cannot be used but a smooth surface is necessary,&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A silicone mould is made in a small paper box. Using release spray is recommended
to avoid the destruction of the silicone mould while removing the 3D print. Spending some
time to prepare the 3D print is suggested to polish its look and feel because
the silicone will capture all its details for all the following resin casts to&amp;nbsp;create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This silicone mould is finally used for a resin cast. One can use the silione
mould many times. The casting should be done in a well ventilated room, believe&amp;nbsp;me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ucreatestudio.is.ed.ac.uk/"&gt;uCreate Studio from the University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt;  which enabled me to
test multiple prototypes of the 3D print in various sizes and resolutions.
Thanks to their Mike Boyd for ideas on how to realize this project.
This place is truely exceptional and an amazing opportunity for students
to learn anything! I believe the uCreate Studio is a concept that needs to be copied
from universities across the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;

techniques that ressemble genetic evolution. One such complex problem can be the
learning process of a neural network: Using genetic algorithms for this purpose
is referred to as&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Neuroevolution&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across nice projects that use genetic algorithms to learn neural networks
that controll the behaviour of some agents in a simplified&amp;nbsp;world:&lt;/p&gt;

high as when developed in Python but in return I will learn object-oriented programming
in C++, the compilation tool-chain and modern C++ standards such as&amp;nbsp;2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural network topologies: The concepts of neural networks and their topology is
part of this project as I implement the neural network from scratch. This is
particularly simple in this case because only forward evaluations are&amp;nbsp;required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artificial simplified world and agent-based learning: The idea of individuals who
live in a simplified world and respond to their environment seems like an exciting

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did 120 push ups, 6 times 20 repetitions spread arbitrarily over the day, for 30 days
starting the 04/24/2017. The last of these workouts has been done the 23rd of May 2017 without
skipping any repetition during the 30 days. After all, I performed 3600 push&amp;nbsp;ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the 29th of May 2017, I measured my maximal number of push ups anew. Initially, I performed
42 with 20 warming up&amp;nbsp;repetitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time without warming up repetitions, I performed 70 push ups. This is a performance I am
happy&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="experiences"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After approximately 15 days into the challenge, I felt that my handstand and overall
shoulder strength increased. Exercices such as holding a frog position without leaning on my knees
became more accessible and the initial phase of a straddle press felt like I could make future progress
with. In comparison to my pull up challenge of 50 pull ups a day for 30 days in the winter 2015/2016,
this challenge has not had an as big impact on my daily life in terms of soreness and time consumption.
However, also the performance increase hasn&amp;#8217;t been as dramatic. Generally, one should make sure that the
excercise performed in such a challenge is not too difficult as the body will struggle even with the
simplest excercises when repeated that often. While I underestimated that for the past
pull up challenge, I did take this into account for the just finished push up challenge. Getting the 6
sets done over a day was relatively easy so that one could think of performing more than 6 sets. I
did the repetitions exclusively on parallets which (a) protected my wrists and (b) increased the range of
motion. My wrists never made any problems and, amazingly, I got used to the increased range of motion
so that regular flat-hand push ups feel easy now. While the wrists were fine throughout the challenge,
my shoulder felt irritated sometimes. However, never to the degree of pain but mostly only&amp;nbsp;cracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="outlook"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various future challanges came to my&amp;nbsp;mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3x 50 push up repetitions a day: For increasing the maximal number. 20 repetitions were too easy
after some&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;L sit to tucked press (explained in terms of the frog position above). I might train these excercises
separately at first to build up enough strength for the&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frog stand on&amp;nbsp;parallets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stretching routine each&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stretching routine seems the most appealing for me now as it is more passive after such an active&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I apply the training method &amp;#8220;Greasing the groove&amp;#8221; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="#gtg" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; to my push up performance.
My interpretation of this method&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not train the excercise to&amp;nbsp;fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train the excercise very&amp;nbsp;frequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application to push ups means in this case for&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the maximal performance. Performance is measured as number of
proper-form push ups. To relax my wrists and increase the range of motion, I use my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt;
parallets or knuckles if no parallets are available. &lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;:
42 push ups after a warm up set of 20&amp;nbsp;repetitions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform half of the maximal performance - 20 in my case at the time being -
six times each day for 30 days. I determined the set number of six by available
time each day, integration in my other physical training and exhaustion. The number of
sets should be distributed equally over the day and are possibly integrated in other training
occasions. The equal distribution includes working times and time at&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purposes of this study&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase push up performance. While push ups are an essential excercise, I found
them surprisingly exhausting. I had very good experience with 50 (ring) pull ups
each day for 30 days for my pull up performance in winter&amp;nbsp;2015/2016.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase overall push performance. This will help for more complex composite movements
