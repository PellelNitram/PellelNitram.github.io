<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design"><span class="caps">CAD</span> modeling</a> for building things is awesome! However, when it comes to organic shapes,
that cannot be made up of the typical squares and circles, even designers with an intermediate skill level start to&nbsp;struggle.</p>
<p>Luckily, 3D scanning can help to get 3D models of organically shaped&nbsp;objects.</p>
<p>Hence, I show you here how to utilise 3D scanning specifially for <span class="caps">CAD</span> modeling - and all that without the need for a <span class="caps">GPU</span> or a powerful <span class="caps">PC</span>.
As an exemplary project that also solves one of my (not so important) problems, I set myself to design a box for my (organically shaped) <span class="caps">PC</span> mouse.
This will help me to carry my <span class="caps">PC</span> mouse in my backpack more&nbsp;easily.</p>
<p>This is the agenda for this&nbsp;tutorial:</p>

<h2>Scan&nbsp;preparations</h2>
<p>Since we use photogrammetry here, the texture of the object to be scanned should be as feature-rich and dull as possible.
If the object you plan to scan is shiny, you have to make sure to cover it in some non-shiny material: Some people use
painter&#8217;s tape, special powder or simply flour if your object permits. Furthermore, as photogrammetry identifies features
of your object, or generally speaking your whole scene, you should also make sure that the whole scene in which you take
the photos is&nbsp;feature-rich.</p>
<p>As an example, I am scanning my portable computer mouse here. Since it is shiny, I covered it in painter&#8217;s tape that I
removed later on again. Additionally, I drew random symbols on that painter&#8217;s tape to assist the photogrammetry software to find
distinct features that can be matched throughout the set of&nbsp;pictures.</p>

        Video 1: All photos of the <span class="caps">PC</span> mouse rendered into one video. The individual picture quality has been
        reduced for this video in order to ensure a reasonably small video file size. The quality of
        the images used for the 3D scan, however, has not been reduced in any way as to get the highest scan&nbsp;quality.
    </p>
</div><p>The animation in Vid. 1 shows a video of all the images that I used for the photogrammetry procedure. As you can see in Vid. 1,
I made sure to cover the object in all possible angles, even multiple times and including close-ups of sections that might
need additional coverage. To ensure enough distinct features in the scene, I designed an A4 sheet printout with random symbols
on it: You can download it <a class="reference external" href="/3D_scanning_print_out.pdf">here</a> to print
the <span class="caps">PDF</span>&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<p>For the whole set of images I used a phone camera. I shot it outside on a cloudy day to guarantee an even lighting as photogrammetry
does not cope well with hard&nbsp;shadows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="d-scanning-with-meshroom">
<h2>3D scanning with&nbsp;Meshroom</h2>
<p>I use the free and amazing software <em>Meshroom</em> (<a class="reference external" href="https://alicevision.org/">https://alicevision.org/</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom">https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom</a>) to perform the 3D
scan of the <span class="caps">PC</span> mouse, see Fig. 1 for a screenshot of Meshroom. There are great tutorials on Meshroom out there. I used, for example, this one:
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4NTf0hMjtY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4NTf0hMjtY</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/how_to_use_3D_scanning_for_CAD_modeling/meshroom_2019.2.0.png"><img alt="" src="/images/how_to_use_3D_scanning_for_CAD_modeling/meshroom_2019.2.0.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 1: Meshroom version 2019.2.0 <span class="caps">GUI</span> screenshot. The whole computation performed by Meshroom is defined by the &#8220;Graph Editor&#8221;
in the bottom and consumes pictures imported into the &#8220;Images&#8221; area. The final result is shown in the &#8220;3D&nbsp;Viewer&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, Meshroom requires a <span class="caps">CUDA</span>-capable (i.e. somewhat powerful) <span class="caps">GPU</span> to yield the best 3D scanning results. In the following, I show
how to run Meshroom (a) without a <span class="caps">GPU</span> on your computer at the cost of lower scan quality and (b) in the Google cloud on <em>Google Colab</em> for free
at the cost of lacking a <span class="caps">GUI</span>. The <span class="caps">GUI</span> of Meshroom is well thought through and only executes underlying binary
command line tools that can also be invoked without the <span class="caps">GUI</span>. Most of what I am stating here is knowledge collected from the internet so that I can redirect you
to the original sources for in-depth explanations. In the following paragraphs, I expect you to have watched some tutorial on Meshroom as a
dedicated tutorial will explain the details of Meshroom much better than I could ever do&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>To run Meshroom on your computer without a <span class="caps">GPU</span> you should check out <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/wiki/Draft-Meshing">this page</a>.
Also <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/wiki/Error:-This-program-needs-a-CUDA-Enabled-GPU">this resource</a> is very good. In summary,
you remove some of the default steps from the Meshroom computation pipeline, the depth map computation to be specific, in order to remove the computation
steps that require a <span class="caps">GPU</span>. Depending on your computer hardware, the computation might only take a few minutes with these settings. The scan of my mouse
with this technique is shown in Fig. 2&nbsp;(b).</p>
<p>Next, we look into how to run Meshroom in the cloud on a <span class="caps">GPU</span> - for free. The scan of my mouse with this technique is shown in Fig. 2 (a). The procedure is as follows: You start a Google Colab instance, add a <span class="caps">GPU</span> runtime,
upload your images and start the Meshroom commandline binary after downloading it. Since Google Colab runs with Jupyter Notebooks, all these tasks can
be performed easily. Please check out the following notebook that I put together for you in order to start using Google Colab for 3D scanning right now:
<a class="reference external" href="/3D_scanning_colab_notebook.ipynb">click</a>. I based my
notebook off publicly available information, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alicevision/meshroom/wiki/Meshroom-in-Google-Colab-(cloud)">this</a>. My notebook works as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The pictures must be uploaded to the Colab instance as&nbsp;&#8220;my_dataset.zip&#8221;.</li>
<li>Subsequently, they are automatically unzipped, processed and finally the 3D scan is zipped to be&nbsp;downloaded.</li>
<li>My notebook is quite straightforward and well documented. Therefore, check out my comments and texts in
<a class="reference external" href="/3D_scanning_colab_notebook.ipynb">the Jupyter notebook</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 3D scan is saved by Meshroom as an <span class="caps">OBJ</span> file that includes both 3D mesh information as well as the texture of the object. Figure 2 shows the results
of the 3D scan for both of the approaches, with and without <span class="caps">GPU</span>,&nbsp;respectively.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/how_to_use_3D_scanning_for_CAD_modeling/with_vs_without_GPU.png"><img alt="" src="/images/how_to_use_3D_scanning_for_CAD_modeling/with_vs_without_GPU.png" style="width: 700px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 2: 3D scans of my <span class="caps">PC</span> mouse using Meshroom. (a) Scan result using a cloud <span class="caps">GPU</span> to enable the full computation pipeline <span class="amp">&amp;</span> highest quality of Meshroom.
(b) Scan result using Meshroom&#8217;s <span class="caps">CPU</span>-only computation&nbsp;steps.</p>
</div>
<p>While the <span class="caps">CPU</span>-only computation pipeline is quicker to compute and executable on any computer, the <span class="caps">GPU</span>-enabled features of Meshroom do increase
the quality of the 3D scan significantly. They require a <span class="caps">GPU</span> and take slightly longer to compute, on the order of one hour vs on the order of minutes. Figure 2
might not be able to convey the detailed differences between the models, as it is just an image, but the <span class="caps">GPU</span>-enabled scan is much more detailed than the <span class="caps">CPU</span>-only scan: The <span class="caps">CPU</span>-only
model consists of 43,512 scanned faces while the <span class="caps">GPU</span>-enabled scan consists of 1,043,705 scanned faces. Hence, the <span class="caps">GPU</span>-enabled scan detected almost 20x more
faces than the <span class="caps">CPU</span>-only model using the exact same pictures of the <span class="caps">PC</span>&nbsp;mouse.</p>
<p>Therefore, I recommend to always use a <span class="caps">GPU</span> to compute Meshroom 3D scans, in particular taking Google Colab into account as it offers free <span class="caps">GPU</span> compute&nbsp;power.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="d-model-post-processing">
<h2>3D model post&nbsp;processing</h2>
<p>As photogrammetry identifies features in the images that are used in order to derive the camera perspectives, the scans might pick up parts of the
scene in which the scan is created. I used a <a class="reference external" href="/3D_scanning_print_out.pdf">custom-made printout</a>
to ensure that there are enough distinct features. Figure 3 (a) shows the raw
scan that comes out of Meshroom using the <span class="caps">GPU</span>-enabled computation pipeline executed on Google Colab and Fig. 3 (b) shows the same scan but a manually tidied up version of it. I used <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> to remove all excess parts of the scan that are not of&nbsp;relevance.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/how_to_use_3D_scanning_for_CAD_modeling/raw_scan_vs_trimmed.png"><img alt="" src="/images/how_to_use_3D_scanning_for_CAD_modeling/raw_scan_vs_trimmed.png" style="width: 700px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 3: Cleaned 3D scan. (a) The model as computed by Meshroom. (b) Manually trimmed model to only consist of the mouse itself and no more scene&nbsp;parts.</p>
</div>
<p>Clearly, removing the artefacts is a mandatory step here. Depending on what you want to do with your scanned model, there is another mandatory step:
Reducing the complexity of the 3D model by removing vertices. The original model as shown in Fig. 3 (a) consists of 1,043,705 faces and the trimmed
model in Fig. 3 (b) consists of only 423,706 faces without reducing the model quality at all as only the excess parts of the scan were removed.
For many applications though, even these 400k faces are too many. One such application being (consumer-grade) CADs (on a consumer-grade <span class="caps">PC</span>), I removed
the number of faces even further before exporting the model to an <span class="caps">STL</span> file. Figure 4 shows exactly&nbsp;that.</p>
<div class="figure">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/images/how_to_use_3D_scanning_for_CAD_modeling/stl_resolutions.png"><img alt="" src="/images/how_to_use_3D_scanning_for_CAD_modeling/stl_resolutions.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Figure 4: <span class="caps">STL</span> models of my scanned <span class="caps">PC</span> mouse after reducing the number of faces. (a) The original file as shown in Fig. 3 (b) after exporting it
to <span class="caps">STL</span> (and, hence, without texture) with 423,706 faces. (b) <span class="caps">STL</span> with the number of faces reduced to 15% of the original model. (c) <span class="caps">STL</span> with the
number of faces reduced to 0.15% of the original model. Subfigures (b) and (c) were generated with Blender by using its
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/decimate.html">decimate modifier</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Since I wanted to use the model to design a box around it, I needed it in <span class="caps">CAD</span>. Most of the <span class="caps">CAD</span> software support generic model formats like <span class="caps">STL</span> or <span class="caps">OBJ</span>
but can also transform these formats to their native data format. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5v8JO7pEAk">These</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://toglefritz.com/convert-a-simple-stl-into-a-body-in-fusion-360/">two</a> resources show how to transform an <span class="caps">STL</span> to Fusion 360&#8217;s native data format. This is very useful for all subsequent design steps but it comes at a high computational cost when the model is too detailed. Hence, I used the model shown in Fig. 4 (c) for being converted to a
native Fusion 360 object and to model my <span class="caps">PC</span> mouse box&nbsp;around.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-a-cad-model-around-the-3d-scan">
<h2>Building a <span class="caps">CAD</span> model around the 3D&nbsp;scan</h2>
<p>I used the coarse-grained <span class="caps">STL</span> shown in Fig. 4 (c) to build my box around it. To do so, I imported it into Fusion 360 - the <span class="caps">CAD</span> I am using here - and designed a wooden
box around it. In order to take advantage of having the organic shape of my mouse in <span class="caps">CAD</span>, I designed custom 3D printed pieces as inserts for the wooden box to
ensure that the mouse does not move around inside the box while carrying it&nbsp;on-the-go.</p>
<p>To have the full capabilities of Fusion at hand for my mouse 3D scan, I converted it into the native Fusion data format as mentioned in the previous section. With this, I was able to use my scan with all joints and features inside Fusion. My finished <span class="caps">CAD</span> model is shown in Vid.&nbsp;2.</p>

<h2>Fabrication and assembly of the mouse&nbsp;box</h2>
<p>I made use of my private 3D printer to fabricate the organically shaped custom inner blocks for the wooden box. The wooden box itself,
I fabricated on my small hobby laser&nbsp;cutter.</p>
<p>The assembly is achieved step-wise: First, I glued the 3D printed plastic pieces to the wooden sides of the box, see Fig. 5 (a). Subsequently,
I glued these wooden sides together with painter&#8217;s tape, see Fig. 5 (b), to ensure that everything fits together before doing the final&nbsp;glue-up.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Figure 5: First two steps of assembly process. (a) Plastic pieces are glued to the wooden box sides and pads are attached to
the 3D printed pieces to minimise the slag of the mouse inside the box and to avoid scratches on the mouse.
(b) The wooden box as assembled temporarily with painter&#8217;s tape to ensure proper&nbsp;fitting.</p>
</div>
<p>Only after these two steps, I glued the wooden box sides into place with wood glue to achieve a permanently assembled wooden box, see
Fig. 6 (a). Lastly, I applied clear coat to all of the wooden pieces, see Fig. 6&nbsp;(b).</p>

<p class="caption">Figure 6: Next two steps of assembly process. (a) The permanent box glue-up with wood glue. (b) Application of liquid clear coat as
finish and to make the box more&nbsp;sturdy.</p>
</div>
<p>As a next step, I prepared the wooden lid for the box using the laser cutter again. Afterwards I cut and glued the leather pieces in place that
attach the lid to the main box body. There are three places that make use of the leather pieces: First, the piece that serves as hinge of the lid, second
the strap to secure the lid to the box with a velcro and lastly another leather piece is placed symmetrically to leather hinge for aesthetic
reasons. Figure 7 shows the finished leather&nbsp;parts.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, I presented how the open-source 3D scanning software <em>Meshroom</em> can be used to produce 3D scans without a <span class="caps">GPU</span> using

and <em>Google Colab</em>. Subsequently, I showed how the 3D model can be used for <span class="caps">CAD</span> modeling.
My demonstration use case was a transportation box for my <span class="caps">PC</span> mouse because it is a suitable object to be scanned and used in <span class="caps">CAD</span>.</p>
<p>The steps for obtaining a 3D scan that can be used for <span class="caps">CAD</span> modeling are shown in Fig. 9. While I explain the <span class="caps">CAD</span>-specific steps with
<em>Autodesk Fusion 360</em>, similar steps apply for most <span class="caps">CAD</span> software that are on the&nbsp;market.</p>

<p>Particularly useful is the 3D scanning script for <em>Google Colab</em> that I provided. With that, you are not required to own a <span class="caps">GPU</span>-enabled <span class="caps">PC</span> anymore.
Hence, the only thing you need to do to get your own 3D scan is to capture a set of pictures of the object you want to&nbsp;scan.</p>
<p>Happy&nbsp;scanning!</p>
